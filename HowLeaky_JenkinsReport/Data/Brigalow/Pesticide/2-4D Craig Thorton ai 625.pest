    <SorptionCoefficient Comments="This is the ratio of concentration in the soil matrix to the concentration in the soil water. &#xA;A highly sorbed pesticide (such as glyphosate) has a sorption coefficient &gt;100. These pesticides are primarily transported by mass movement with sediment.&#xA;Low sorption (e.g. atrazine) is indicated by a coefficient &lt;10. These pesticides are transported by rainfall runoff, leaching and with sediment.&#xA;&#xA;As given in Table 3 of&#xA;Shaw et al. 2011.

    <ExtractCoefficient Comments="This is the proportion of pesticide 'extracted' in the runoff and erosion of soil by rainfall. Research by Mark Silburn indicates that this is a conservative property, especially when comparing pesticides with a wide range of Sorption Coefficients.&#xA;&#xA;Typical values are a few percent. The default value is 0.02 or 2%. Values from 0.01 to 0.04 are plausible.&#xA;&#xA;Some of the factors affecting the extraction coefficient are those affecting soil/rainfall mixing during runoff. These include rainfall intensity (increased intensity increases extraction), soil type (dispersive soils may have greater extraction) and pesticide attributes (ionic/non-ionic bonding, low/high molecular weight).   &#xA;&#xA;As given in Table 3 of&#xA;Shaw et al. 2011.
